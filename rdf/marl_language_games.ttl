Two scripts are available in the directory `scripts` at the moment:

```
run_experiment.py # running a full experiment with multiple trials
run_competition.py # running an experiment solely for the purpose of creating competition graphs
```

Both scripts allow the following command-line args:

- `--cfg`
  - [required] [str]
  - specifies a path to a yml config file
  - examples of configs can be found in the `cfg/` directory
- `--debug`
  - [optional] [flag] [default: `false`]
  - specify whether to log DEBUG-level messages
  - messages are logged to a logfile in the unique directory under `--log_path`
- `--print-every`
  - [optional] [int] [default `1000`]
  - requires `--debug` flag to be set
  - logs every x-th communicative interaction (and prints to stdout)

For example, the following command runs the basic naming game experiment with the parameters specified in the configuration file found at `cfg/config.yml`.

```
python scripts/run_experiment.py --cfg cfg/config.yml --debug --print_every 5000
```

        """##Installation
Anaconda is probably the fastest way to get up and running with Python environments. However, the full Anaconda toolkit installs 1500 Python packages and takes up 3GB of disk space. A good alternative, therefore, is Miniconda. Miniconda will only install the bare minimum to run Python. It is then up to you to manually install the packages that you _really_ need.

Download Miniconda from [this website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and follow the installation instructions. If you are prompted to add Miniconda to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`, accept. For the changes to take effect and use `conda` from the command line, you must restart the Terminal. At the time of writing, the Miniconda website suggests to install Miniconda with Python 3.7.

The `environment.yml` file presents in this repository makes it easy to recreate the `marl_language_games` conda environment that was used to develop this project. This file lists all necessary packages and their version numbers. You can use the Makefile to setup this environment.

1. To recreate the `marl_language_games` conda environment that was used to develop this project, run:
   - `make install_conda_env`
2. If the environment was successfully created, you can activate it by running
   - `conda activate marl_language_games`
   - You should see the prompt of your Terminal change from `(base)` to `(marl_language_games)`.
3. Then to install the `marl_language_games` package into the newly create `(marl_language_games)` environment, run:
   - `make install_package`
   - You should see the `marl_language_games` package when listing all dependencies of the environment through `conda list`.
